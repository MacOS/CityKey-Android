    <div class="confluence-information-macro-body"><p><strong>ACCESSIBILITY STATEMENT</strong></p>
        <p>We aim to make our app accessible without barriers. It should be designed to be in
            compliance with national legislation implementing Directive (EU) 2016/2102 of the
            European Parliament. The following accessibility statement applies to the Citykey apps
            for Android and iOS.</p>
        <p><strong>Status of compatibility with respect to the requirements for barrier-free
            information technology</strong></p>
        <p>This app is currently not yet fully compatible with the requirements according to BITV.
            The accessibility of the app is undergoing constant improvements as part of our
            development process.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Non-accessible content</strong></p>
        <p><em>Contrast</em></p>
        <p>There is currently some content for which the contrast is too low. We are currently
            looking into how we can increase the contrast in line with Citykey's color scheme.</p>
        <p><em>Button size</em></p>
        <p>Some clickable objects (e.g. buttons, links) in the Android app may be a bit too small
            for users with motor weaknesses. We are currently investigating to what extent changes
            to the size are possible and useful.</p>
        <p><em>Dynamic text size in iOS</em></p>
        <p>Citykey for iOS does not support dynamic text sizes at the moment. We are currently
            planning to successively support this feature throughout the apps.</p>
        <p><strong>Creation of this accessibility statement</strong></p>
        <p>This statement was created on July 30, 2021.&nbsp;The assessment is based on
            self-assessment, with the support of accessibility testing software tools, and with the
            assistance of a visually impaired user.</p>
        <p><strong>Feedback and contact</strong></p>
        <p>We appreciate feedback on the accessibility of our app. Have you discovered any other
            barriers in our app or do you have any questions about accessibility? Then feel free to
